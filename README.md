## VsCode Extension

github Repo: [https://github.com/Paneddo/vscode-File-Length](https://github.com/Paneddo/vscode-File-Length/)

**Feature Ideas**:
- [ ] Show length of all open files
- [ ] Let the user choose which file types (``*.py``, ``*.js``, ``*.txt`` etc...) he wants the extension to be active for
